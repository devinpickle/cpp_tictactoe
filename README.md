# Overview

This program was made to help me learn C++ by starting with a simple and fun program.

This is a tic tac toe game made with C++. It lets you play through a full game and play both as X and O.

I set out to write this software with the goal of learning C++. I had no prior experience with this language. My goal was to learn how the language works at a level that I could confidentely add it to my list of other skills.

# Development Environment

To build this program, I installed and learned how to use Visual Studio and how it integrates Git.

The C++ language was used to create this program.
